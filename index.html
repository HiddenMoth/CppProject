        <h2>What is Writing?</h2>

        <p>
            What do you consider writing to be is different form person to person, where some can 
            say,” A picture is worth a thousand words.”, but the following question would be is 
            the person who made the painting a writer or a painter? It is difficult to give a 
            definite answer on what is writing or who/what is a writer, because everyone has 
            their opinions based on their experiences and knowledge. I think writing is anything 
            that conveys information to an audience. This includes events in nature like fluvial 
            erosion, which is when water runs off on a mountain and carves a path as it descends 
            creating valleys and canyons. This information about the landscape can be understood 
            and explains how water shapes landmasses over time through wearing down rock and soil. 
            This is an example of mother nature as a writer.

 <section id="writer" class="section writer-bg">
        <h2>Who is a Writer?</h2>

        <p>
	        While the first example of mother nature as a writer sounds a bit out there, I want to take a 
            step back and consider what is writing? If you cannot read a paper because it is in a 
            different language, you are unable to understand the information. This is something that 
            is shown in math, where information is centered around patterns, structures, and traces 
            that carry information. Writing for math is shown as symbols, equations, proofs and graphs.
            Proof is an assumption to conclusion, where it breaks down the process step by step. 
            The methods of solving a proof can range from creating a logical equivalent statement 
            or finding a contradiction in the negation of the statement. The symbols and markings 
            you put in these proofs may seem foreign and abstract, but they communicate precise ideas 
            and information to those who have learned how to read them. This is why I define writing
            as any system that can encode and relay that information in a way that can be interpreted
            or understood by others.

    <!-- The Object Section -->
    <section id="object" class="section">
       <h2>The Object</h2>
        <p>
            My writing is a website, where I wrote down in this essay about what I considered to be 
            writing, writer, and why I choose my two forms of writing media. My three forms of writing 
            that we used in class are HTML/CSS, Xerography, and ChatGPT, a LLM chatbot. The HTML/CSS 
            is used to provide structure to the website and shape how things are organized and control
            all the visual design. The Xerography is used in creation of a QR code that allows others
            to use a physical object to find my digital website. Lastly, I used an LLM chatbot to help
            me find a provider for the website and help me revise and test ideas I had for my project.

    <!-- Reflection Section -->
    <section id="reflection" class="section">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
    Creating this project helped me connect course ideas about writing to my own experiences as a mathematics 
    major and someone who enjoys hiking and geology. In math, I am used to thinking in terms of symbols, 
    equations, and proofs, but this project made me think of those forms as writing—carefully composed texts 
    meant to be read and interpreted by others.
</p>

<p>
    Hiking and learning about geology also influenced my thinking. Trails, rock layers, and river channels all 
    function like texts that can be read for information about time, force, and change. Seeing these as forms 
    of writing expanded my idea of who or what can be a writer, including natural processes and the people who 
    study and move through those environments.
</p>

<p>
    Technically, this project blends multiple media: HTML/CSS for an interactive digital text, and xerography 
    through a printed QR code that circulates the project in physical space. Conceptually, it blends disciplines, 
    using mathematics and geology as lenses for understanding how writing encodes and communicates information.
