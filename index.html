        <h2>What is Writing?</h2>

<p>
    Writing is understood differently by everyone. As a mathematics major and someone who spends a lot of time 
    hiking, I see writing not only as words on a screen or page, but as patterns, structures, and traces that 
    carry information over time.
</p>

<p>
    In math, writing shows up in the form of symbols, equations, proofs, and graphs. A proof is a kind of 
    narrative: it takes you from assumptions to a conclusion step by step. A function written as 
    <code>f(x)</code> on a page is a compact way of describing an entire relationship. These marks may look 
    abstract, but they communicate precise ideas to anyone who has learned how to read them.
</p>

<p>
    Hiking and geology offer a different kind of writing. Trails, rock layers, and river channels are physical 
    records of processes unfolding over long periods of time. Fluvial erosion, for example—water carving its way 
    through rock and soil—writes a story into the landscape. From the shape of a valley or the layers in a cliff, 
    geologists can read information about climate, time, and the forces that shaped that place.
</p>

<p>
    From this perspective, I define writing as <strong>any system that encodes and communicates information in a 
    form that can be interpreted</strong>. That might be mathematical notation on a board, hieroglyphics on a wall, 
    or strata in a canyon. All of these are ways of recording something so that it can be read later, by someone 
    else—or even by ourselves in the future.
</p>

    </section>

    <!-- Who is a Writer Section -->
<section id="writer" class="section writer-bg">

        <h2>Who is a Writer?</h2>

<p>
    If writing is any system that encodes information, then a writer is anyone—or anything—that creates those 
    systems and leaves those traces. That certainly includes authors of books and essays, but it also includes 
    mathematicians, scientists, designers, and even natural forces.
</p>

<p>
    Mathematicians are writers when they compose proofs, define new concepts, or model a real-world situation 
    with equations. A proof in a textbook is not just “doing math”; it is a crafted piece of writing meant to be 
    read, interpreted, and built on by others. The same is true for a well-labeled graph, a clear diagram, or 
    a set of carefully written definitions.
</p>

<p>
    In the context of hiking and geology, nature itself can function as a writer. Rivers carve canyons, glaciers 
    leave behind moraines, and tectonic forces fold rock layers. Hikers then become both readers and writers: 
    we read the landforms to understand where we are, and our footpaths, cairns, and trail reports create new 
    marks and records for future hikers.
</p>

<p>
    In this expanded view, writers include people, communities, tools, and environments that participate in 
    shaping and transmitting information. A meme online, a contour map, a topographic profile, or a worn trail 
    can all be forms of writing, and the creators behind them are all, in different ways, writers.
</p>

    <!-- The Object Section -->
    <section id="object" class="section">
        <h2>The Object</h2>
<p>
    This website is the object that answers the core questions of the project. Its structure, design, code, and 
    interactive layout demonstrate how writing extends beyond alphabetic text into digital forms. The background 
    images and examples draw specifically from my interests in mathematics, hiking, and geology.
</p>

<p>
    The references to fluvial erosion and landscape features connect writing to geological processes, while the 
    language of functions, relationships, and systems echoes mathematical ways of thinking. Together, these 
    examples show how different disciplines “write” the world in different but related ways.
</p>

<p>
    The project also includes a printed QR code, produced through xerography. The printout acts as a physical 
    extension of the digital text, linking physical space (like a classroom or hallway) to this online space. 
    In this way, the project intentionally uses multiple media to explore what counts as writing and who can be 
    considered a writer.
</p>

    <!-- Reflection Section -->
    <section id="reflection" class="section">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
    Creating this project helped me connect course ideas about writing to my own experiences as a mathematics 
    major and someone who enjoys hiking and geology. In math, I am used to thinking in terms of symbols, 
    equations, and proofs, but this project made me think of those forms as writing—carefully composed texts 
    meant to be read and interpreted by others.
</p>

<p>
    Hiking and learning about geology also influenced my thinking. Trails, rock layers, and river channels all 
    function like texts that can be read for information about time, force, and change. Seeing these as forms 
    of writing expanded my idea of who or what can be a writer, including natural processes and the people who 
    study and move through those environments.
</p>

<p>
    Technically, this project blends multiple media: HTML/CSS for an interactive digital text, and xerography 
    through a printed QR code that circulates the project in physical space. Conceptually, it blends disciplines, 
    using mathematics and geology as lenses for understanding how writing encodes and communicates information.
