    <!-- What is Writing Section -->
    <section id="writing" class="section">
        <h2>What is Writing?</h2>

        <p>
            Writing is understood differently by everyone. Some people see writing only as alphabetic text, 
            while others view images as a kind of writing—after all, “a picture is worth a thousand words.” 
            If a painting communicates a message, does that make the painter a writer? These questions don’t 
            have simple answers because writing shifts depending on context, medium, and audience.
        </p>

        <p>
            I define writing as anything that conveys information or meaning. That can include non-human forms 
            of writing. For example, fluvial erosion—water carving channels into mountainsides—tells a story 
            about landscapes, time, and natural processes. From these patterns we can read information about 
            risk, landform evolution, and environmental history. In this sense, nature becomes a writer, 
            shaping physical texts across the Earth.
        </p>

        <p>
            But writing is also dependent on interpretation. A message written in a language you can’t read 
            is still writing, even if you do not understand it. The information exists, but accessing it 
            requires knowledge, translation, or context. This raises a central question: if a text cannot be 
            interpreted by its intended audience, does it still function as writing?
        </p>

        <p>
            Ancient civilizations struggled with this challenge. Without durable writing technologies, 
            information could disappear before future generations could understand or preserve it. Cultures had 
            to choose between oral transmission and physical inscription, both of which shaped how knowledge survived.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Who is a Writer Section -->
    <section id="writer" class="section">
        <h2>Who is a Writer?</h2>

        <p>
            So what does this mean for writers? Writing is information, and writers are anything—human or 
            non-human—that creates something capable of storing or transmitting information. But the meaning 
            of that information changes depending on who receives it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Modern examples make this especially clear: slang, memes, and cultural references only work for 
            certain audiences. A meme without context communicates nothing unless you know the original 
            source. Meaning is shaped by community, experience, and shared knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
            There is no minimum or maximum amount of information required for something to count as writing. 
            A single number or an entire encyclopedia can both function as writing. Even early pictographic 
            systems, like Egyptian hieroglyphics, show that writing has always been multimodal, blending images, 
            symbols, sound, and meaning.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- The Object Section -->
    <section id="object" class="section">
        <h2>The Object</h2>
        <p>
            This website is the object that answers the core questions of the project. Its structure, design, 
            code, and interactive layout demonstrate how writing extends beyond alphabetic text into digital 
            mediums. Navigation, visual elements, and HTML/CSS function as rhetorical tools that guide meaning 
            and shape the user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
            The project also includes a printed QR code, produced through xerography. The printout acts as a 
            physical extension of the digital text, showing how writing circulates across spaces, formats, 
            and technologies. In this way, the project intentionally uses two media: web writing and xerography.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Reflection Section -->
    <section id="reflection" class="section">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Creating this project challenged my understanding of writing and writers. I used two forms of media 
            we explored in class: HTML/CSS for digital composition, and xerography to physically distribute 
            access to the website through a printed QR code. These choices show how writing can move across 
            platforms, and how different technologies shape how information is stored, circulated, and interpreted.
        </p>

        <p>
            This project also made me reflect on how meaning depends on audience. Whether through natural 
            processes, ancient inscriptions, or digital artifacts, writing only becomes writing when someone 
            can interpret—or attempt to interpret—the information presented.
