    <!-- What is Writing Section -->
    <section id="writing" class="section writing-bg">
        <h2>What is Writing?</h2>

        <p>
            What you consider writing to be is different from person to person. Some might say, 
            “A picture is worth a thousand words,” but then the next question is: is the person who 
            made the painting a writer or just a painter? It’s hard to give a definite answer about 
            what counts as writing or who/what counts as a writer, because everyone’s view is based 
            on their own experiences and knowledge.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think writing is anything that conveys information to an audience. That can include 
            things we do not usually call “writing.” For example, fluvial erosion—when water runs 
            down a mountain and carves paths that become valleys and canyons—leaves behind a record 
            in the landscape. From those shapes, we can understand how water has worn down rock and 
            soil over time. In that sense, “mother nature” is acting like a writer, leaving traces 
            that can be read.
        </p>

        <p>
            This idea also shows up in math. If you cannot read a paper because it is written in a 
            language you do not know, the information is still there—you just don’t have the tools to 
            interpret it. Math works the same way: a lot of it is centered around patterns, structures, 
            and traces that carry information. Writing in math shows up as symbols, equations, proofs, 
            and graphs. A proof takes you from assumptions to a conclusion step by step. The symbols 
            and markings in a proof may look abstract or confusing at first, but for someone who has 
            learned the language, they communicate precise ideas. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Because of this, I define writing as <strong>any system that can encode and relay information 
            in a way that can be interpreted or understood by others</strong>, even if it takes training, 
            context, or translation to read it.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Who is a Writer Section -->
 <section id="writer" class="section writer-bg">
        <h2>Who is a Writer?</h2>

        <p>
            Once writing is defined this way, a writer can be anyone or anything that creates information 
            and leaves traces for others to understand. That obviously includes people who write books or 
            essays, but it also includes mathematicians, scientists, and even natural processes.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mathematics has evolved over time thanks to information left behind by predecessors. In ancient 
            Egypt, fractions were written using hieroglyphs. Greek mathematicians described ideas using 
            distance and magnitude rather than the algebra we use today. All of this had to be written down 
            somehow so others could read it, learn from it, and extend it. These symbols and methods were 
            preserved and passed on.
        </p>

        <p>
            People like Euclid are good examples of mathematicians as writers. His book 
            <em>Elements</em> collected work on geometry, number theory, and mathematical proofs in a systematic way. 
            He wasn’t just “doing math”; he was composing a text that other people could read, study, and build on. 
            So in my view, writers include textbook authors, proof writers, coders, nature carving a canyon, and 
            anyone or anything that creates a system of marks, structures, or patterns that can be read.

    <!-- The Object Section -->
    <section id="object" class="section">
       <h2>The Object</h2>
        <p>
            My writing for this project is a website. In it, I explain what I consider writing to be, 
            who or what I consider a writer, and why I chose my forms of media. I use three forms of 
            media we talked about in class: HTML/CSS, xerography, and an LLM chatbot (ChatGPT).
        </p>

        <p>
            HTML and CSS provide the structure and visual design of the site. HTML organizes the content 
            into sections and headings, while CSS controls layout, fonts, colors, and background images. 
            Together they show how code itself is a kind of writing that shapes how information is 
            presented and read.
        </p>

        <p>
            Xerography appears in the printed QR code I created for the project. The QR code is a physical 
            object that points people to the digital site. It shows how writing can move between physical 
            and digital spaces and how a printed mark can open up a whole digital text.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also used an LLM chatbot, ChatGPT, as part of my process. It helped me revise my writing, 
            test ideas, and figure out how to structure the project. That raises its own questions about 
            who or what counts as a writer, since a tool like this can influence the text even if it is not 
            a human author.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Reflection Section -->
    <section id="reflection" class="section">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>
    Creating this project helped me connect course ideas about writing to my own experiences as a mathematics 
    major and someone who enjoys hiking and geology. In math, I am used to thinking in terms of symbols, 
    equations, and proofs, but this project made me think of those forms as writing—carefully composed texts 
    meant to be read and interpreted by others.
</p>

<p>
    Hiking and learning about geology also influenced my thinking. Trails, rock layers, and river channels all 
    function like texts that can be read for information about time, force, and change. Seeing these as forms 
    of writing expanded my idea of who or what can be a writer, including natural processes and the people who 
    study and move through those environments.
</p>

<p>
    Technically, this project blends multiple media: HTML/CSS for an interactive digital text, and xerography 
    through a printed QR code that circulates the project in physical space. Conceptually, it blends disciplines, 
    using mathematics and geology as lenses for understanding how writing encodes and communicates information.
