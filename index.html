    <!-- What is Writing Section -->
    <section id="writing" class="section">
        <h2>What is Writing?</h2>
        <p>
            Writing is traditionally understood as the act of inscribing language into a physical or digital form. 
            However, in contemporary literacy studies, writing extends beyond alphabetic text. It encompasses 
            multimodal communication: images, sounds, digital interfaces, gestures, typography, and code. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this course, we explored how writing is not only a tool for communication but also a process of 
            meaning-making, invention, interpretation, and representation. Writing is both material and conceptual: 
            it produces ideas, identities, and social relationships.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Who is a Writer Section -->
    <section id="writer" class="section">
        <h2>Who is a Writer?</h2>
        <p>
            A writer is not defined solely by profession or mastery but by participation in acts of composing. 
            Anyone who engages in shaping meaning—through words, images, digital media, gestures, or design—is 
            practicing writing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this expanded framework, writers include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Students composing academic essays</li>
            <li>Designers building visual narratives</li>
            <li>Coders writing interactive media</li>
            <li>Communities creating shared texts</li>
            <li>Digital tools that support or transform expression</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Writing is an activity that emerges through relationships between people, tools, language, materials, 
            and contexts.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- The Object Section -->
    <section id="object" class="section">
        <h2>The Object</h2>
        <p>
            This website serves as the digital object for the project. As a medium, it demonstrates how writing 
            extends beyond alphabetic text into design, structure, coding, and user interaction. The layout, 
            navigation, and visual choices are themselves forms of rhetorical communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            If applicable, you may also describe a physical or secondary digital object here and explain how it 
            embodies your answer to the core questions.
        </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Reflection Section -->
    <section id="reflection" class="section">
        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            In this section, you will provide your written report or reflection, discussing how your research, 
            readings, and class discussions shaped your understanding of writing and the writer. Reflect on 
            what you learned, how your perspective shifted, and how this project demonstrates your conclusions.
        </p>

    <!-- Sources Section -->
    <section id="sources" class="section">
        <h2>Sources</h2>
        <p>
            List your works cited, course texts, or any digital/media sources used in the project.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Author Last Name, First Name. <i>Book or Article Title</i>. Publisher, Year.</li>
